        <p>This website gather my drawings, done with different techniques and meaning behind. On the page original characters you'll find three of the characters i created, along them you'll be able to find their stories and description of their designs as well. Since my characters' stories were alreday written in english for another project, i decide to keep them that way, so i had to create all of this web site based on english. so you'll find only texts in english in here.
    Secondly, in the page called reaLism you'll find drawings of mine from 2023 to this day. I privilegied realistic drawings for that page since my characters are already done digitally.  </p>

    <p> There was many and many more that i wished to add, but those are the main ones. For example those are the characters where i developped more the stories of and i have more to say about. As for the realistic drawins i chose those i liked the most as well as the ones i spent the most time on. </p>
    <h2>Website's layout</h2>
    <p>The website is fully written in english because i had some of my characters' stories already written in english for another project so it was easier that way. You'll see that one of the characters, Ace, has a more developped page, that's because i've already started writting his whole story as i futur project of mine is to draw a comic on it. </p>
