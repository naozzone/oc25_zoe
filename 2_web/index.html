        <p>This website gather my drawings, done with different techniques and meaning behind. On the page original characters you'll find three of the characters i created, along them you'll be able to find their stories and description of their designs as well. Since my characters' stories were alreday written in english for another project, i decide to keep them that way, so i had to create all of this web site based on english. so you'll find only texts in english in here.
    Secondly, in the page called reaLism you'll find drawings of mine from 2023 to this day. I privilegied realistic drawings for that page since my characters are already done digitally.  </p>
