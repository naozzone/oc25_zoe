    <h2>Lewis's design</h2>  
        <p>He was designed to be a royality. I based him off his compaion which is his red and black tiger. He has a red earring which is his family's symbole.
            His bright red eyes reflet the pure royal blood he has. 
            His best friend is a fantastic tiger whose name is Aslan.
            Lewis has all he wishes in his life, he's a good prince and he fights for what he thinks is right.
