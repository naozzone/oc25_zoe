    <h1> Lewis's story</h1>

    <body>
        <p>Lewis is a prince. He was raised by a good family at the reign of the empire and of course he was destined to take the leadd once he's ready.
            He was gifted a baby tiger at his birth, as the red tigers lived along the Ashford Family for decades. 
        </p>
    <h2>Lewis's design</h2>  
        <p>He was designed to be a royality. I based him off his compaion which is his red and black tiger. He has a red earring which is his family's symbole.
            His bright red eyes reflet the pure royal blood he has.
