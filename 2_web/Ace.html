    <h1>Ace's story</h1>
        <p>Ace lives in an apocalyptic world, where monsters called 'visitors' took over the world. when the military took over the power and gathered all the survivants in their selucded bases, they all lived off their commun efforts, there was no time to think about money. 
            Yet a greedy scientist who thought only of the power he could get from this downfall. That same scientist is the reason of the awakening of the monsters, as he played with the dead's soul, he transformed them as horrible monsters, blood thirsty. 
        With all thos monsters and experiences, the scientist has trasformed Ace's brother into a vistor and when he could get his hand into his dead's soul, he brought him back to life by combining their both souls, both of the souls lived in the same body. As the visitor of Ace brother's soul, the main goal was to kill, while Ace only wantedfor this terror to end. </p>
    <h2>Ace's design</h2>  
        <p>His design was meant to show a man that lived through hard time, he was endurced by the harsh realiy of the apocalyptic world and the hardwork of what the world became. On his body appears budging black stains. like a parasite in his body, it's the visitor's soul. The visitor could take over and transform his whole body into a terrifying creature. </p>

It was a dark night in a cold winter when Ace finally broke through the system. 

[Subject n*197592 disconnected]

Red lights blew in the abandoned warehouse, scientists frantically ran around shouting orders as heavy doors began to close. Emergency lockdown. Glass shattered, piercing through it’s skin, subject n*197592 ran with certainty, having learnt by heart the abandoned center plans over the past months. His escape was calculated and planned. He executed it without any hesitation. 

The base security was called. Weird giant and fast successful agents were behind him.

CATCH HIM.

The main order. Having a subject trying to escape wasn’t rare, it happened quite often. Having a subject escaping that well, that was more impressive. 

They wanted him alive. Untouched.

He could have been the best weapon the organization could have created. He could have been their best asset. But his mind was set on other priorities, freedom, his own identity that he was forced to forget. His memories were blurred but one thing for sure was that he wasn't a monster. At least a part of him wasn’t. 

He wanted to know and learn who he was before being captured by that organisation that made him the monster that he is today.

After breaking out of his cells even through the heavy security systems, he passed by a trap that security failed to detect, a way that he had observed while being detained and guided through the center. He had seen and noticed the defective cable that was normally connected to the security station. He made his way through it, dark and dusty, he didn’t care if his hands were dirty, they were already covered in blood. It felt wrong just thinking of it.

The air became colder as he landed outside, it was the recycling center. Where nasty and broken creations were thrown, discarded as if their bodies, their minds didn’t matter at all. 

Ace felt compassion, those could have been him, if the experience on him hadn’t worked the way it did, he could have ended up as one of the composers. 

He didn’t have time to think about that, security agents were behind him, having cut himself with the glass of his cell, he left behind him a trail of blood, security had no problem finding where he went through. He jumped over the fences, well he had seen himself doing so in his mind but now he was in front of a big heavy fence made of pure stone.

He felt blocked, he had thought of his escape plan thoroughly, but he hadn't seen that wall coming. Was he destined to end in a scientific center? Should he give up on his plan and accept being a weapon? He was good at it, he was programmed for it, to kill. He was the best at it. Well the part they had injected in him. That voice in his head telling him to go back to his cell, where he belonged. 

It’s the end.

The agents were right behind him, telling him to stop and give up, that he was nothing but a pure object they could use, he shouldn’t have needs.

Panic suddenly cursed through him, he had never felt that before. His heart was pounding in his chest, he couldn’t understand what was happening. He even thought that those crazy scientists had implanted something into his heart in case that scenario happened.

The black marks on his body, the monster they had injected in his body started hurting, it burns.

His eyes stung, he struggled to stay on his feet. What was happening to his body? The half of his body, cursed, corrupted was hurting so much that the other half felt numb. 

A sudden force exploded in his chest, he needed to focus.

“Get it together!”

He forced the voice in his head to listen to him, he fought against the monster in him.

He had the power, he could control his own body.

His cursed arm lifted and with a single blow, he pierced a hole in the reinforced wall, the security agents hid to safety, nobody ever scratched that wall, now it had a hole in it.

Through the shadows, the subject escaped, running from his nightmare, running from his fears. He didn’t stop.

Security immediately separated in groups, teams were formed to find him.



He can’t be out there. 
He was a monster for the population, he could turn the whole world into chaos.
